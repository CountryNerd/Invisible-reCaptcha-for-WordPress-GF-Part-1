# Invisible-reCaptcha-for-WordPress-GF-Part-1
This is not mine but their current version does not work so this is my fix.

1. Get your keys for Invisible Recaptcha from https://www.google.com/url?q=https://g.co/recaptcha/invisiblesignup&sa=D&ust=1490201241697000&usg=AFQjCNFDZFudeV6RGUFLW2bGaABpsSNUDA

2. Network Activate it. And under Gravity Froms Check the box for protection. 
  ** Important you need to install part 2 so you can enable it on a page by page basis.
  
3. Install Part 2
